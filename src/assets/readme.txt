EAN Boilerplate

A quick boilerplate for applications based around ExpressAngularNode (EAN), leaving the back end up to the developer.

It's basically MEAN without mongodb to act as the backend.  It's already pre-configured to use handlebars for server side templates, but with angular it's assumed that you won't be using this too much as angular will be handling the templates.

The applications I build tend to be backend agnostic and if a backend is needed then it can be rolled in when needed.  Most of the time I'm consuming existing api endpoints from elsewhere rather than rolling out my own backend for an application.
